                    <p>
                        Sequential decision making under uncertainty is a key challenge for AI systems. 
                        Reinforcement Learning is a paradigm where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. 
                        The agent takes actions in various states of the environment and receives rewards based on the outcomes of these actions.
                        This approach has been used in diverse areas such as autonomous systems, game playing, robotics, and heathcare.
                        This course will cover the basics of reinforcement learning as well as deep reinforcement learning
                        â€” an exciting new area that combines deep learning techniques with reinforcement learning.

                    <p>The course objectives are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The course intends to familiarise students with the key features of reinforcement learning</li>
                        <li>Students will learn about fundamental RL algorithms and implement them in code</li>
                        <li>Given an application problem, students should be able to decide whether it should be formulated as an RL problem. 
                            If yes, they should be able to formulate the problem, decide which algorithm to use, and implement the algorithm.

                    <p>Below are the guidelines for assignment submissions:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Collaboration: You are free to discuss the problems with other students in the class. 
                            However, the final solution/code that you produce should come through your individual efforts.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Submission Platform: The required code should be submitted using the Moodle Page.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Honor Code: Any cases of copying will result in a zero on the assignment. 
                            Additional penalties will be imposed based on the severity of the copying.
                            Any copying cases run the risk of being escalated to the Department/DISCO.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Use of Code Generated from LLMs: Code generated from Language Models (LLMs) will be considered cheating. 
                            Any such code found in your submission will be treated as a violation of the honor code.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Copying Code from Online Resources: Copying code from any online resource is also considered copying. 
                            Ensure that all code submitted is your original work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Late Policy: You are allowed a total of 5 buffer days (combined) for all programming assignments. 
                            There is no penalty if your submission stays within the limit of the 5 buffer days (total). 
                            For each additional day beyond the allowed 5 buffer days, you will lose 10% of the score for every late day in submission.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
